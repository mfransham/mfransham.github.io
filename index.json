Your collaborators all want to do the analysis in Stata: boo :(\nWhile there are a lot of resources out there that teach Stata users how to work in R, the reverse is not true. The only resources I can find on teaching R users how to use Stata is this Stata to R cheat sheet which is designed for going from Stata to R, but is useful for the other direction too.\nHere are my notes on going from R to Stata, a gift from my present to my future self as I attempt to make myself Stata-literate. If they are useful for you too, then great!\nSome key resources  \rGetting Started with Stata for Windows (release 17) (abbreviated GSW below) \rStata to R cheat sheet  Script files Script files in Stata are called \u0026lsquo;do-files\u0026rsquo;, matching their file extension .do. They are edited in the \u0026lsquo;Do-file Editor\u0026rsquo; which you can open either with a toolbar button or Window -\u0026gt; Do-file Editor. Comments in do files begin with an asterix * or double forward slash // and you can run code with the ctrl+d shortcut (similar to ctrl+Enter in R).\nThe basic structure of Stata syntax is\ncommandname main_arguments, optional_arguments\ni.e. optional arguments that modify Stata commands are (optionally) included after a comma that follows the required arguments. Arguments in Stata are not generally enclosed in brackets and, apart from the one comma above, multiple arguments are generally not separated with commas (unlike R).\nHelp on Stata commands can be found using help commandname at the comment line or searching from the Help menu.\nThe working directory Like R, Stata has a working directory concept. This is the place where outputs will be saved, and is also the place Stata will look for data if importing from the command line rather than using File -\u0026gt; Open. The working directory is displayed in a ribbon at the bottom of the main Stata window. The working directory can be changed at the command line with cd or from the File menu.\nImporting data To import delimited text files such as comma-separated, tab-separated etc, use the command import delimited followed by the name of the file. From GSW: \u0026ldquo;if filename contains spaces, put double quotes around the filename, and include the path if filename is not in the current working directory\u0026rdquo;. For example:\nimport delimited my-file.csv\r This will also import directly from a URL, for example:\nimport delimited \u0026quot;https://sites.psu.edu/psucz/files/2018/09/counties90-29c6g4u.csv\u0026quot;\r Excel files can be imported using import excel. An example:\nimport excel \u0026quot;../../../Data/Boundaries/United States/ipums_puma_1990_5pct/1990_PUMAs_5pct.xls\u0026quot;, firstrow\r Here, the option firstrow tells Stata to use the first row as variable names. Note that Stata supports relative file paths with ../ in the same way as R.\nOnce imported, a dataset can be browsed using the Data Editor - a button for this is at the top of the Stata window. The Variables Manager can be used to check the variable types and import format etc.\nno; data in memory would be lost So this is where Stata gets a bit frustrating for an R user. If you try to import a second dataset after having imported another, you will get the above error message. This is because Stata can only hold a single dataset in memory at one time. To clear the current dataset from memory type clear. Obviously this will delete any unsaved changes.\nRenaming, dropping, reordering variables keep var1 var2 ...\rdrop var1 var2 ...\rorder var1 var2 ...\rrename oldname newname\r Create new variables gen newvar = expression\nFor example:\ngen fips = State * 1000 + CountyFIPScode\nThis will not overwrite an existing variable - unlike R, the user will get an error message. To overwrite an existing variable use replace.\nJoining datasets This isn\u0026rsquo;t too difficult to do, but as far as I can tell so far there are some issues with doing this in Stata that are irritating to the R user who is used to the left_join etc functions in dplyr:\n only one dataset in memory at a time, so you can\u0026rsquo;t look at them both the variables that you are joining on must have the same name the external file you are merging (i.e. the one not currently in memory) must be a .dta file  The command in Stata is merge. Example:\nmerge m:1 fips using counties, keepusing(ers90)\r In this case fips is the variable to join on, m:1 means many-to-one join, counties is the dataset brought in to merge, ers90 is the one variable from counties that we want to keep when merged.\nErasing files erase filename.ext\nI needed to do this as a consequence of having to write out a csv file as a dta file so that I could then use merge.\nDescriptive statistics summarize or summ for short, the detail option gives additional statistics. One variable can be specified, otherwise the entire dataset is summarised (similarly to summary() in R). Example:\n\r tabstat and tabulate are useful options for categorical variables, I believe.\ngroup_by() and summarise() The equivalent to group-by() %\u0026gt;% summarise() in Stata is collapse. For example\ncollapse (sum) PUMApopnincz = Areapopulation, by(ers90 State PUMA PUMApopulation)\r This replaces the existing dataset with a collapsed dataset, grouped by the variables in by(varlist). The specification of summary values (there can be more than one) come before the comma. Translation of the above: for records grouped by the variables in by(), summarise Areapopulation with the function sum and store it in a new variable PUMApopnincz. If no grouping variables are specified in by() this summarises the entire set of observations.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e13129c478ec6d4fac6be5fefac77565","permalink":"https://mfransham.github.io/blog/guide-to-stata-for-r-users/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/guide-to-stata-for-r-users/","section":"blog","summary":"Stata for R users: a quick start guide So you have an exciting international research collaboration: hurray!
